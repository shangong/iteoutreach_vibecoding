Act as an expert frontend developer and creative coder. Build a classic Snake game using a single-file structure (HTML/CSS/JS).
The Vibe: Cyberpunk Neon. Use a dark background with vibrant, glowing neon colors for the snake (green) and food (pink).
Epic 1: Core Mechanics
As a player, I want to control a snake on a grid using arrow keys.
As a player, I want the snake to grow when it eats food.
As a player, I want the game to end if I hit a wall or myself.
As a player, I want the game speed to increase slightly every time I eat food, making the game progressively harder.
Epic 2: Visuals & Polish
As a player, I want the snake and food to have a 'box-shadow' glow effect to look like neon lights.
As a player, I want a smooth frame rate so the movement feels fluid.
Epic 3: UI & Scoring
As a player, I want to see my current score and high score on the screen.
As a player, I want a 'Start Game' button and a 'Game Over' overlay with a 'Restart' option."
